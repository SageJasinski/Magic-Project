            <h2>How to read the top of the card</h2>

            <p>The best way to start learning how to play magic is starting with how to read the card.
                Luckily for you, every card follows the same format and once you know what to look for then reading the cards is actually quite simple.
                Let's start with the top of the card. At the top you will always find two things, The name of the card and how much mana you need in order to play the card.
                Mana is the name of the resources you will get through the game and what you will use to put your cards from your hand to the table.
                Note that there are 5 different colors of mana Red, Green, Blue, Black, and White. The number in a grey circle means you only need that much mana of any color kind
                of like a wild card, Then it will usually be followed by a color symbol which means you need 1 of that specific color of mana or if there are multiple symbols you need that many 
                of that color of mana. For example if the symbol looks like this:
                <br>
                <img src="Basic-Land.jpg" height="200" width="300"> 
                <br>
                It is saying that you need two mana of any color <strong>and</strong> one red mana in order to put this card on the table.

            <h2>How to read the Middle of the card</h2>
            <img src="Basic-Land.jpg" class="img-center">
            <p>
                At the center of every card you will find all sorts of information about what this card is. Let's start from the left side and work our way 
                to the right. On the left you have what type of card this is. There are four basic card types which we will go over here.
                <br>
                <h3>1) Creatures</h3>
                <p>
                    Creature cards go straight to the table and will have two numbers on the bottom of the card. These numbers will come in 
                    later when we talk about combat. For now, when you pay the mana you put it right on the table.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>2) Enchantment</h3>
                <p>
                    Enchantments can be played on either other cards or put on to players. In the card description it will say what it is allowed to enchant,
                    For example it will say "enchant Creature" this means the enchantment can only enchant a card that is a Creature.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <h3>3) Sorcery</h3>
                    When you play a sorcery card on your turn you do what the bottom of the card says and then instead of it going to the table
                    it instead will go to your Graveyard or "discard" pile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>4) Instant</h3>
                    <br>
                    An instant is the only card you can play on both your turn <strong>AND</strong> on your opponents turn. They function the exact same way
                    as sorcery cards, where you play the card then once you've done everything it says it goes to your graveyard pile.

            <p>
                This is the meat of the card. this is where every card differs, often times the rule here is "reading the card explains the card." there can
                be some trick words that often aren't explained on the card, for that I have made a section on this site for a cheat sheet of terms that you can 
                use to look up any unfamiliar words. It is important to note that every word on the card is there for a reason and meant to be taken literally 
                if it says "a player" then that can be anyone not just you. Magic is an ever changing game in the moment so it is important to read the card and ask yourself
                "How is this card changing the game?"

                <br>
                The only time you need to pay attention to the bottom is when its a creature. You will see two numbers on every creature card often represented by a 
                fraction i.e. 2/3. The number to the left is referred to as Toughness, this is how much damage this creature will do when you attack with it. The second number is referred to as the creatures 
                Defense this is how much damage the creature can take, once its defense go to zero or bellow the creature is put in your graveyard. For more on combat check out the 
                Your turn section of this site.
