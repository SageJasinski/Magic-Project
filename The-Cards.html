            <h2>How to read the top of the card</h2>

            <p>The best way to start learning how to play Magic is to learn how to read the card. Luckily for you, every card follows the same format so once you 
                know what to look for then reading the cards is actually quite simple. Let's start with the top of the card. At the top you will always find two 
                things, the name of the card and how much mana you need in order to play the card. Mana is the name of the resources you will get through the game 
                and what you will use to put your cards from your hand to the table. Note that there are 5 different colors of mana: Red, Green, Blue, Black, and 
                White. The number in a gray circle means you only need that much mana of any color, kind of like a wild card. Then, it will usually be followed by
                color symbol which means you need one of that specific color of mana or if there are multiple symbols you need that many of that color of mana. For 
                example, if the symbol looks like this:
                <br>
                <img src="Basic-Land.jpg" height="200" width="300"> 
                <br>
                It is saying that you need two mana of any color <strong>and</strong> one red mana in order to put this card on the table.

                At the center of every card, you will find all sorts of information about what the card does. Let's start from the left side and 
                work our way to the right. On the left, you have what type of card this is. There are four basic card types that we will go over.

                <br>
                <h3>1) Creatures</h3>
                <p>
                    Creature cards go straight to the table and will have two numbers on the bottom of the card. These numbers will come in 
                    later when we talk about combat. For now, when you pay the mana you put it right on the table.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>2) Enchantment</h3>
                <p>
                    Enchantments can be played on specified cards or affect players. The card description will say what it is allowed to enchant. For example, 
                    it will say "enchant Creature." This means the enchantment can only enchant a card that is a Creature.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <h3>3) Sorcery</h3>
                    When you play a sorcery card on your turn, you do what the bottom of the card says, and then instead of it going to the table, it will go to 
                    your Graveyard or "discard" pile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>4) Instant</h3>
                    <br>
                    An instant is the only card you can play on both your turn <strong>AND</strong> on your opponent's turn. They function the exact same way
                    as sorcery cards, where you play the card then once you've done everything it says it goes to your graveyard pile.

                This is the meat of the card. This is where every card differs, often times the rule here is "reading the card explains the card." There can be 
                some tricky words that often aren't explained on the card; for that, I have made a section on this site for a cheat sheet of terms that you can 
                use to look up any unfamiliar words. It is important to note that every word on the card is there for a reason and meant to be taken literally. 
                If it says "a player" then that can be anyone, not just you. Magic is an ever-changing game at the moment so it is important to read the card and
                ask yourself "How is this card changing the game?"

                The only time you need to pay attention to the bottom is when it is a creature. You will see two numbers on every creature card often represented 
                by a fraction i.e. 2/3. The number to the left is referred to as toughness, this is how much damage this creature will do when you attack with it.
                The second number is referred to as the creature's defense; this is how much damage the creature can take. Once its defense goes to zero or below,
                the creature is put in your graveyard. For more on combat, check out the Your Turn section of this site.
