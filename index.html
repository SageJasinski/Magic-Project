            <h2>The History</h2>
            In 1991, a company called Wizards of the Coast was printing role playing games out of then CEO Peter Adkison's basement when Dr.Richard Garfield, 
            a doctoral candidate in combinatorial mathematics, came to them with the idea to produce a board game called "RoboRally." Peter didn't know if they 
            could make a board game so he asked Dr.Richards to come up with a game that could be carried around and played while waiting in lines. A few weeks 
            later, Dr.Richards came back with the idea for a card game called Magic. The game was produced and presented at the Origins Game Fair in 1993 where 
            it was so well received that a year's supply of cards was bought, which was all they had produced so they had to issue an emergency reprint.
