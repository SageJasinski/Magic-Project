        <h2>History of Magic</h2>
        <p>
           In 1991 a company called Wizards of the coast what printing role playing games out of then CEO 
           Peter Adkison's basment when Dr.Richard Garfield, a doctoral candidate in combinatorial mathmatics,
           came to them with the idea to produce a board game called "RoboRally." Peter didn't know if they could make a board game so he asked Dr.Richarrds to
           come up with a game that could be carried around and played while waiting in lines. a few weeks later Dr.Richards came back with the idea for a card game called
           Magic. The game was produced and presented at the origins game fair in 1993 where it was so well recived that a years supply of cards was bought which was all they
           had produced and they had to issue an emergencey reprint.
